# Project specific Scala/SBT docker image

This docker image is tied very specifically to a project I'm currently cleaning up. The image isn't small, neat, fast or anywhere near
to what I want it to be. So, in short; don't use it unless you have the exact same requirements as I do.

Contains:

* scala 2.10.6
* sbt 0.13.12
* some caching garbage
